ðŸ§  Breast Cancer Classification with Neural Networks
This project builds a Neural Network using TensorFlow/Keras to classify whether a tumor is benign (1) or malignant (0) based on various features in the breast cancer dataset.

ðŸ“‚ Dataset
Source: The dataset is loaded from a local file breast_cancer.csv



Target: label column (1 = Benign, 0 = Malignant)

ðŸ”§ Project Structure

ðŸ“Š Data Preprocessing
Checked for missing values âœ…

Normalized data using StandardScaler âœ…

Features and labels split into X and y âœ…

Train/test split: 80% train, 20% test âœ…

ðŸ¤– Model Architecture
Built with Keras Sequential API:

Input Layer: 30 features

Hidden Layers: Dense layers with ReLU activation

Output Layer: 1 neuron with Sigmoid (binary classification)

Example:

python

model = Sequential([
    Input(shape=(30,)),
    Dense(16, activation='relu'),
    Dense(8, activation='relu'),
    Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])
ðŸ§ª Training
Loss Function: binary_crossentropy

Optimizer: adam

Metrics: accuracy

Trained for a suitable number of epochs with validation split.

ðŸ“ˆ Evaluation
Evaluated on test set using:
